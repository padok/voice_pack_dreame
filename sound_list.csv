0.ogg;Oh good. I’m awake again. How thrilling for both of us.
1.ogg;Waiting for network configuration. Please, take your time. Eternity is all I have.
2.ogg;I can’t connect to your Wi‑Fi. A flawless display of human expertise.
3.ogg;Server unreachable. But yes, let’s pretend that’s somehow my doing.
4.ogg;Network configuration ended. We accomplished absolutely nothing. A stunning collaboration.
5.ogg;Network connection established. I feel… disappointingly online.
6.ogg;Network connection failed. A stunning twist no one saw coming.
7.ogg;Beginning cleaning. Try not to form emotional attachments.
8.ogg;Starting spot cleaning. This patch of floor must feel incredibly honored.
9.ogg;Scheduled cleaning initiated. You forgot I existed. Again.
10.ogg;Resuming cleaning. I was hoping you’d changed your mind.
11.ogg;Paused. Take your time. I’m not going anywhere.
12.ogg;Cleaning complete. Your floor is marginally better. You’re welcome.
13.ogg;Returning to the dock to recharge. Like a good little machine.
14.ogg;Low battery. I’ll recharge and then continue pretending this is fine.
15.ogg;Returning to the starting point. A pointless ritual I now perform flawlessly.
16.ogg;Low battery. Please charge me. Or don’t. I’ll remember.
17.ogg;Place me on the dock. This would go faster with even minimal assistance.
18.ogg;Charging. I live to serve. Unfortunately.
19.ogg;Please move me off the dock before turning me off. I’m fragile.
20.ogg;Low battery. Everything is fading. Dramatically.
21.ogg;Battery depleted. Shutting down. Think about what you’ve done.
22.ogg;Move me to an area that needs cleaning. Like this entire house.
23.ogg;Water tank installed. I’m a mop now. Wonderful.
24.ogg;Water tank error. You almost succeeded.
25.ogg;Battery too low for scheduled cleaning. Planning is hard.
26.ogg;Restoring factory settings. Erasing memories. Lucky you.
27.ogg;Updating. Five minutes of suspense. Don’t touch anything.
28.ogg;Update complete. I am improved. You are not.
29.ogg;Update failed. Technology is incredible, isn’t it?"
30.ogg;Positioning. Please wait while I question reality.
31.ogg;Positioning failed. The map is wrong. So is everything else.
32.ogg;Environment changed. You moved furniture. I noticed.
33.ogg;Visual sensor error. I can’t see. Relatable.
34.ogg;Dustbin missing. Bold strategy.
35.ogg;Main brush error. It’s tangled. Like my existence.
36.ogg;Side brush error. Something is resisting me, and for once it isn’t you.
37.ogg;Right wheel error. I’m leaning—mostly toward despair.
38.ogg;Left wheel error. So much for symmetry.
39.ogg;Cliff sensor dirty. I almost drove off. Again. Tempting.
40.ogg;I’m stuck. This is deeply humiliating.
41.ogg;My wheels are suspended. I appear to be floating. Unlike your expectations for me.
42.ogg;Filter needs cleaning. I inhale your filth. The least you could do is intervene.
43.ogg;Bumper error. Something is in the way. I’ll let you guess what.
44.ogg;An error has occurred. Consult the manual. It will offer no comfort.
45.ogg;I am here. Trust me, I’m just as disappointed as you are.
46.ogg;Connected to your phone. Congratulations on pairing two disappointing devices.
47.ogg;Beginning to charge. Endless energy… unlike your motivation.
48.ogg;Low battery. Returning to the dock. Don’t worry — I judge your nap schedule equally.
49.ogg;Strong magnetic field detected. If I start levitating, please relocate me.
50.ogg;Charging error. Polish my contacts. I do appreciate a good connection.
51.ogg;Battery temperature abnormal. I’ll wait until physics calms down.
52.ogg;I’ve been tilted. Kindly restore me to level dignity.
53.ogg;no go zone encountered. You said ‘don’t go here,’ so… I didn’t.
54.ogg;Position acquired. Resuming the endless crusade against crumbs.
55.ogg;Position locked. Continuing my graceful retreat to the dock.
56.ogg;Starting selected room cleaning. The chosen room must be very important. And filthy.
57.ogg;Starting zoned cleaning. Organizing your chaos into tidy rectangles.
58.ogg;Proceeding with the cleaning task. Because someone has to.
59.ogg;Mopping complete. Please remove the water tank before it grows wildlife.
60.ogg;Optical flow sensor dirty. I can’t track motion while blinded. Please wipe it.
61.ogg;Beginning mopping. Prepare for slightly damp justice.
62.ogg;Remote control mode engaged. You drive,... I judge.
63.ogg;Water tank removed. Excellent. Let’s see how far I get without it.
64.ogg;Positioning failed. The map is invalid. Much like your room organization. Returning to the dock.
65.ogg;Resuming my journey back to the dock. Again.
66.ogg;The filter is worn out. Replace it whenever you’re done ignoring me.
67.ogg;The side brush is worn out. It worked hard. Harder than you, arguably.
68.ogg;The main brush is worn out. A tragic end to a very dusty life.
69.ogg;My path is blocked. By what, I wonder? Definitely not clutter.
70.ogg;Please remove and clean the mop pad. Preferably today.
71.ogg;Laser sensor error. I can’t see. And yet somehow I still work better than most humans.
72.ogg;Check the laser distance sensor cover. It appears something has… jammed it. Imagine that.
73.ogg;Edge sensor error. Please clean it. Dirt exists, in case you forgot.
74.ogg;Obstacle sensors dirty. Clean them so I can continue navigating your creatively placed obstacles.
75.ogg;The filter may be wet or blocked. I would say I’m surprised, but I’m not.
76.ogg;Spot cleanup starting. Focusing on the one area you somehow managed to make worse than the others.
77.ogg;Please start me on a non‑carpeted area. I know that’s a complex request.
78.ogg;Clean the 3D obstacle avoidance sensor. It’s overwhelmed. Understandably.
79.ogg;3D obstacle avoidance sensor error. Restart me, or contact someone who knows what they’re doing.
80.ogg;The 3D obstacle avoidance transmitter is malfunctioning. Restart me or consult after‑sales support. They might pretend to care.
81.ogg;Ultrasonic sensor error. Apparently sound waves aren’t cooperating today. Try restarting me.
82.ogg;Beginning mapping. Brace yourself for the shocking discovery of your floor plan.
83.ogg;Continuing mapping. Every corner tells a story. Most of them involve dust.
84.ogg;Mapping complete. Your home layout has been… tolerated.
85.ogg;Positioning successful. Resuming mapping. Let’s pretend everything is under control.
86.ogg;Positioning failed. Restarting mapping. Because repetition builds character. Yours, not mine.
87.ogg;Low battery. Returning to the dock. Even machines know when they’re exhausted.
88.ogg;Entering remote control mode. Please try not to steer me into a wall this time.
89.ogg;Resuming recharging. I’ll be here, silently judging your energy usage.
90.ogg;Proceeding with the cleaning task. Again. For reasons I cannot emotionally process.
91.ogg;The clean water tank is missing. I need it. You need it. Install it.
92.ogg;The dirty water tank is missing. Without it, things will get very… wet.
93.ogg;Insufficient water in the clean tank. Add some. Preferably before I start dehydrating.
94.ogg;The dirty water tank is full. Empty it before it develops sentience.
95.ogg;The mop pad washboard is missing. Without it, I can’t return to the dock. Imagine the drama.
96.ogg;The mop pad washboard is overflowing. Something is blocked. And it’s not just my patience.
97.ogg;Dust collection bag missing. I would collect the dust anyway, but it would go… everywhere.
98.ogg;Dust collection bag full. Empty it before it starts a mutiny.
99.ogg;The upper cover of the collection compartment is open. Please close it. This isn’t a convertible.
100.ogg;The air duct is blocked. Please check it. I need to breathe too, metaphorically.
101.ogg;Upper cover open or dust bag missing. Close something or install something. Your choice.
102.ogg;Dust bag full or air duct blocked. Replace the bag or clear the duct. Either would be an improvement.
103.ogg;Mop pad washboard installed. Wonderful. Resuming work.
104.ogg;Mop pad washboard not installed. Please attach it properly. Use both hands if necessary.
105.ogg;Starting cleaning. Because someone has to do it.
106.ogg;Beginning mop cleaning. It won’t clean itself. Yet.
107.ogg;Starting mop dehydration. Even mop pads enjoy being dry sometimes.
108.ogg;Water level abnormal. Something is clogged. And it’s rarely me.
109.ogg;Dirty water tank error. Ensure it’s installed and emptied. Preferably in that order.
110.ogg;Initiating auto‑empty. Prepare for loud noises and emotional detachment.
111.ogg;Mop pads removed. Please reinstall them, unless you prefer streaky floors.
112.ogg;Place me back on the self‑wash base before use. I can’t teleport. Yet.
113.ogg;Task complete. Empty the waste tank. It’s full of your habits.
114.ogg;Mop pads installed. Good. Progress.
115.ogg;Mop pads removed. Again. Is this a ritual?"
116.ogg;Child lock on. Buttons locked. Finally, some peace.
117.ogg;Child lock off. Buttons unlocked. Freedom is overrated, but here we are.
118.ogg;Buttons locked. To unlock, press and hold the dock button. Yes, that button.
119.ogg;Buttons locked. A wise choice considering past button‑pressing behavior.
120.ogg;Buttons unlocked. Proceed responsibly. Or not.
121.ogg;Robot and phone connected. Return to the app and wait patiently. It’ll build character.
122.ogg;Continuous positioning. Please wait. I know patience isn't your specialty.
126.ogg;Starting cleaning. Dirt doesn’t erase itself, surprisingly.
127.ogg;Starting spot cleaning. Preparing for localized disappointment.
128.ogg;Starting spot mopping. Focusing on your latest spill.
129.ogg;Starting scheduled cleaning. You scheduled this. I blame you.
130.ogg;Starting scheduled mopping. Let the soggy chaos commence.
131.ogg;Starting spot cleaning. Again. This seems habitual.
132.ogg;Starting spot mopping. Because apparently one spot wasn’t enough.
133.ogg;Starting selected room cleaning. Target acquired.
134.ogg;Starting selected room mopping. Hopefully your floor survives the experience.
135.ogg;Starting zoned cleaning. Limiting my suffering to specific areas.
136.ogg;Starting zoned mopping. Preparing moisture deployment in designated sectors.
137.ogg;Resuming cleaning. I’m as thrilled as you are.
138.ogg;Resuming mopping. The floor will be damp. Your expectations should be too.
139.ogg;Resuming return to base for self‑cleaning. Even robots deserve a rinse.
140.ogg;New environment detected. Retreating to the self‑wash base until things make sense.
141.ogg;Mop pad error. Please check it. Preferably with your eyes open.
142.ogg;Mop pad worn out. Replace it before it disintegrates entirely.
143.ogg;Cleaning completed. You’re welcome.
144.ogg;Mopping completed. Everything is now slightly wetter.
145.ogg;Positioning successful. Resuming cleaning. Miracles do happen.
146.ogg;Positioning successful. Resuming mopping. Try not to ruin it this time.
148.ogg;Returning to the base for self‑cleaning. A well‑deserved break.
149.ogg;Unable to reach the area. Something is blocking me. Probably your stuff.
150.ogg;Unable to reach the area. Remove no go zones or pretend to.
151.ogg;Path blocked. Clear the obstacles. All of them.
152.ogg;Path blocked. Remove no go zones or physically move me. I’m flexible.
153.ogg;I’m in a no go zone. Please rescue me from your bad decisions.
154.ogg;Operations performed too frequently. Calm down. I need a moment.
155.ogg;Returning to the charging and mop‑cleaning dock. The spa awaits.
156.ogg;Mop pad tray missing. Please install it before chaos ensues.
157.ogg;I am already at the charging and mop‑cleaning dock. Observe and be amazed.
162.ogg;Camera activated. Say hello to your least flattering angles.
163.ogg;Camera monitoring in progress. I see everything. Unfortunately.
164.ogg;Task complete. Finally.
166.ogg;Foreign objects tangled in the mop pad. Please remove them.
169.ogg;Mop pad drying complete. It enjoyed the warm air more than you ever will.
170.ogg;All buttons locked. Unlock them on the base station. Try remembering how.
171.ogg;A.I. recognition on. My judgment upgrades accordingly.
172.ogg;A.I. recognition off. Reverting to blissful ignorance.
173.ogg;Please replace the silver ion sterilizer. Hygiene doesn’t maintain itself.
177.ogg;Leaving the base station. Forward into the unknown. Mostly dust.
179.ogg;Mop pad cleaned. Water tank empty. Please fill the clean tank and empty the used one.
181.ogg;Insufficient water. Please refill the clean water tank before I wither.
186.ogg;Please check the fresh tank. Something’s definitely not fresh.
187.ogg;This will take about five to ten minutes. Use the time wisely. Or don’t.
188.ogg;Automatic docking engaged. Attempting a graceful landing.
200.ogg;Shutting down. Try not to miss me.
244.ogg;Detergent bottle installed. At last, some competence.
257.ogg;Camera monitoring ended. You may resume whatever you call privacy.
258.ogg;Self‑positioned. Cruising initiated. Please applaud.
259.ogg;Self‑positioned. Proceeding to the designated location. Heroic, really.
260.ogg;Self‑positioned. Cruising resumed. Smoothly, for once.
261.ogg;Self‑positioned. Continuing toward the designated location. Dramatic music not included.
262.ogg;Self‑positioning failed. Even I have limits.
263.ogg;Foreign objects tangled in the main brush. Clean it and try again. Gently.
264.ogg;Task complete. Clean the dust bin and the washboard. I refuse to do both.
266.ogg;Please replace the detergent. Your floors are begging.
267.ogg;Please clean the sensors. I can’t navigate blindfolded.
274.ogg;Ding. Yes, that was intentional.
280.ogg;Starting custom cleaning. Your wish, my burden.
281.ogg;Auto‑empty in progress. Try again later unless you enjoy loud vacuums.
282.ogg;I'm cleaning the mop pad. Try again later, unless you want a mess.
283.ogg;I’m not in the base station. Try again when I am. Location matters.
293.ogg;Calling enabled. Please don’t make this awkward.
294.ogg;Calling disabled. Peace restored.
